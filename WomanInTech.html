<h2> <font color="blue"> About Me: </font></h2>

<p> Biography: I am fifteen years old and I attend, Alnoor School as a rising 10th grader.<br> I have a few hobbies such as reading and coding. I live in Staten Island and go to school in Brooklyn, although transport is difficult it is all worth it in the end.<br> I was in many extra curriculars such as debate and girls who code as well, <br>these experiences helped me realize my goal and ambitions in life.</p>

<br> <h2> <font color="firebrick"> Fun Fact About Me: </font></h2>

<h3>
<p> I am the quality control engineers for the abuse project, although I could not have done it without the help of my team mates. They have taught me many things that had a major impact on weather or not I had completed the tas of the day. One of the many are, how to put in a full unrepeated background as simlpe as it was I could not have done it without them.</p>
<p>  My hopes for hte future is that I do not give up or lose my passion for coding I hope to never lose my patience as a programmer and actually fulfill and persue a career in computer science.</p>
<p> One peice of advice I would give to a girl struggling and trying to persue a career in comp sci is to stick to it and dont give up beause it may be fustrating and dificult but it is totally worth it in the end. </p>
